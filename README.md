# Vendor Performance Analysis
Inventory & Vendor Performance Analysis –  An end-to-end analytics pipeline designed for a medium-sized manufacturing company to optimize inventory management and vendor performance. Leveraging real-world scale data (multi-million-row CSVs), this project demonstrates industry-standard practices in data engineering, statistical analysis, and business intelligence:  Data Ingestion & Logging Custom Python scripts load raw transaction files into a SQL database with comprehensive logging, ensuring reliability and auditability.  Data Transformation & Modeling SQL and Python are used to aggregate and cleanse transactional tables—purchases, sales, inventory snapshots, purchase prices, and vendor invoices—into a single, vendor-level summary table.  Advanced Analytics & Hypothesis Testing Jupyter notebooks guide the process of feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and statistical testing to uncover insights on stock turnover, carrying costs, and vendor profitability.  Interactive Business Intelligence A professionally designed Power BI dashboard brings key metrics to life, enabling stakeholders to monitor profit margins, unsold inventory valuation, and reorder recommendations in real time.  Anonymized Data for Confidentiality Actual product and brand names have been replaced with generic placeholders (e.g., “Product A,” “Product B”) to protect sensitive information while maintaining analytical fidelity.  Outcome: A robust, production-ready framework for informed decision-making in inventory control and supplier performance—suitable for real-world deployment in any manufacturing or supply chain setting.
